# Keylogger Project

This project is a simple keylogger created for educational purposes. It records keystrokes from the keyboard to understand how keyloggers work and how they can be detected or prevented.

## Features
- **Programming Language/Tool Used**: Developed using PYTHON.
- **Keystroke Logging**: Records keystrokes accurately.
- **Detection Avoidance**: Implements techniques to avoid detection by antivirus software.

## Purpose
This project is designed for learning purposes only. It provides insight into how keyloggers operate and how they can be detected in cybersecurity. The goal is to understand keylogging methods to improve security practices.

## **Important**
**This project is for ethical and educational use only. Misuse for spying or violating privacy is strictly against ethical guidelines.**

## Usage
To use the keylogger:
1. Download the repository.
2. Compile the code (if necessary) based on the language/tool used.
3. Run the program to record keystrokes.

## Acknowledgments
- Thanks to all the cybersecurity researchers who contribute to ethical hacking knowledge.
